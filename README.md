# Election_Analysis


## Overview Of Election Audit

- Two employees who work for an election commission based in Colorado requested my help analyzing some election results. They provided me with a CSV file containing:
* The ballot IDs of the voters in this election
* The county in which they voted
* The candidate whom they voted for

I was given the task of analyzing this data in order to help them find the following:
*The voter turnout for each county
*The percentage of votes from each county out of the total vote count 
*The county with the highest turnout

I was able to find all of this information using several codes that were written in the Python language.

## Election-Audit Results

### How many votes were cast in this election?

- I was able to write a python code in order to obtain this information without having to count through the extensive data one by one. What I found was that there were 369,711 votes in this election. I did this by using a For Loop to add a vote count for every row of data in our CSV file.
